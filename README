This is a Quiz Application i wrote back in 2007. It uses parallel port for interfacing the buzzer switches.
I have used IO.dll from geekhideout (http://www.geekhideout.com/iodll.shtml) to talk to the parallel port.
The application also requires Adobe Shockwave Player to be installed as it uses a lot of flash animations.
The application was used in the National Level Quiz Competition conducted during our technical events Brainwaves.
It was fun to watch the application being used in front of a lot of audience, where, it ran without any glitch.
Anyone who wants to use the application or wish to develop further , please contact me, i would be glad to help.
